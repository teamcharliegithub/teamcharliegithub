## Bio
I'm a university student with research interests in the intersections of health, medicine, engineering, and cybersecurity. 
I code mainly in Python, and I also have some experience with Java.
I enjoy working on projects that solve life's little problems and force me to learn and adjust to technologies and approaches with which I am unfamiliar.
